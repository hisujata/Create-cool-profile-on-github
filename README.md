# Create-cool-profile-on-github

Hey you, how is it going? 

I had a really boring looking profile on github. So, I decided to create a cool looking profile.

Here is how I created it.

First head to github and create a new repository. Now your repository name should be same as your github profile name. 
Why? Well its a special repository from github which will give act like profile page when someone opens your github page.
While creating a github repository dont forget to add README file as its going to play significate role in making your profile look super cool.

Ok now that you got your repository ready, head to google and search for GitHub Profile README Generator.
Dont worry if thats confusing here is the link.

It will look something like this

Now fill all the required details like your name, what you working on, your social media profile name, your website and your skillsets. 

At the end of page you will see add-ons. in here, you can add whatever you want to display on your profile. I added display visitors count badge, display github profile stats card,display top skills and, display github streak stats.

At last, click on Genrate read me and voila your readme file in HTML code format is ready. 

It will look something like this

Now copy the code and open your github repository which we created earlier and paste the code in the README file. 
Wait dont commit the changes yet. Now we need add some animation and banner image to make it look live and cool.

Now head to canva, go to custom create and create a 1128Ã—191 pixels cool looking banner image. Download and the head your repository copy repository lik and open in new tab on browser. 
Open the repository and add banner image and commit changes. 
Ok so this is the last part. Head to google and get some nice gif you like to add on your profile. If you like you can use gifs from my media repository. 
Here is the link 

# https://github.com/hisujata/Media

Congrats if you did all that. Now, what you need to do is do some changes in your readme file.
Here we need to rihgt some simple HTML syntax to add our banner and gif.  
At the top of your HTML code write below syntax 

# ![logo](your banner link from repositiry that we created)

# <img align="right" src="your gif link from googlr or from my media repository" width="400">

Now you can preview on github itself how the whole thing is looking and if you like commit the changes.
There is something about the dark theme. You can also change the appearance to dark theme as I did it will make your profile look classy.
And bam you have a cool looking profile just like me. 

Creativity rocks!
